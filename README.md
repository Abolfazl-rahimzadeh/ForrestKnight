**Digital worm (Developer/Creator/Student)**

I'm an Iranian computer science student and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish some videos every week on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Abolfazl-rahimzadeh).

 <summary><h3>Abolfazl-rahimzadeh's Life</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world including code, unix, linux, theory, math. And all the while, teaching myself C family development (specially C#) with a dream to build my own app. and now I'm here to slowly learn and tell people what I've learned.
